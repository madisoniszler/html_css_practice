        <h3> Your eyes begin to droop, fluttering shut as you strain to keep them open. Time can't seem to tick by fast enough. There's still work to be done, but you feel lethargic and devoid of energy. <i>Yawn.</i>
        <br />

        <br /> We've all fallen prey to the mid-day slump. At QuickNap, we have a solution: combat your fatigue with a 10-30 minute power nap at one of our 30 locations.
        <br />
        <br /> Here's how it works:
        <br />
        <br /> (1) You create a QuickNap account, which will ask you to input details, such as the average number of hours you sleep per night and work per day.
        <br />
        <br /> (2) You'll be given a recommended nap time length, ranging between 10 and 30 minutes.
        <br />
        <br /> (3) You'll be asked to choose a QuickNap location near you and reserve a slot for a certain day and time. All QuickNap locations have individual soundproof rooms, stocked with a bed, sleeping mask, noisemaker and closet, in case you don't want to soil your work clothes. Light settings can be changed and every QuickNap location has several restrooms.
        <br />
        <br /> (4) On your day and time of choice, you'll pack your pajamas and show up at the QuickNap site you chose. Once there, you'll be escorted to a room.
        <br />
        <br /> (5) Sweet dreams!
        <br />
        <br /> (6) When your time is up, a gentle alarm will sound. To turn it off, you will press a button on the room's wall. If you do not turn it off, it will continue to grow louder.
        <br />
        <br /> (7) You will exit the room and the QuickNap location, returning to work. We'll see you soon!
        <br />
        <br /> (Bonus: If you'd like water or coffee when you wake up, we've got you covered. Ask the receptionist at your QuickNap location for beverage options.
